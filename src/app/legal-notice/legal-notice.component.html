<h3 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Relevant legal bases according to the GDPR:</strong> In the following,
  we provide an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process
  personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR,
  national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of
  residence or domicile. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual
  cases, we will inform you about them in the data privacy policy.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> - Processing is
    necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the data controller or a
    third party, unless the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
    data subject requiring the protection of personal data prevail.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition
  to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection
  regulations apply in Germany. This includes in particular the Federal Data
  Protection Act (BDSG). The BDSG contains special regulations, in particular
  regarding the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object,
  the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other
  purposes, and transmission as well as automated individual decision-making,
  including profiling. In addition, state data protection laws of the individual
  federal states may apply.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Reference to GDPR and Swiss DPA:</strong> These data protection
  notices serve both as information under the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act
  (Swiss DPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this
  reason, please note that due to the broader geographical scope and
  comprehensibility, the terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, the terms
  "processing" of "personal data", "legitimate interest", and "special
  categories of personal data", as used in the GDPR, replace the terms
  "processing" of "personal data", "overriding interest", and "particularly
  sensitive personal data" used in the Swiss DPA. However, the legal meaning of
  the terms continues to be determined in accordance with the Swiss DPA within
  the scope of its application.
</p>

<h3 id="mOverview">Overview of Processing</h3>
<p>
  The following overview summarizes the types of data processed, the purposes of
  their processing, and refers to the data subjects.
</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="m27">Security Measures</h3>
<p>
  We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of
  protection appropriate to the risk, in accordance with legal requirements and
  taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, the nature,
  scope, circumstances, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying
  likelihood and severity of the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural
  persons.
</p>

<p>
  These measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality,
  integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic
  access to the data, as well as their access, input, disclosure, availability,
  and segregation. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the
  exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data
  breaches. We also consider data protection during the development or selection
  of hardware, software, and procedures, in accordance with the principle of
  data protection by design and default settings.
</p>

<h3 id="m25">Transmission of Personal Data</h3>
<p>
  As part of our processing of personal data, it may be necessary to transmit
  the data to other places, companies, legally independent organizational units,
  or individuals or disclose them to them. Recipients of this data may include
  service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and
  content integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with legal
  requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements
  with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.
</p>

<h3 id="m225">Provision of Online Offerings and Web Hosting</h3>
<p>
  We process users' data in order to provide them with our online services. For
  this purpose, we process the user's IP address, which is necessary for
  transmitting the contents and functions of our online services to the user's
  browser or end device.
</p>

<ul class="m-elements">
  <li>
    <strong>Processed data types:</strong> Usage data (e.g., visited websites,
    interest in content, access times). Meta, communication, and process data
    (e.g., IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, consent status).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Data subjects:</strong> Users (e.g., website visitors, users of
    online services).
  </li>

<ul class="m-elements">
  <li>
    <strong>Collection of access data and log files:</strong> Access to our
    online offering is logged in the form of so-called "server log files."
    Server log files may include the address and name of the accessed web pages
    and files, date and time of access, transmitted data volumes, report of
    successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system,
    referrer URL (the previously visited page), and usually IP addresses and the
    requesting provider. Server log files can be used, on the one hand, for
    security purposes, e.g., to prevent server overload (especially in the case
    of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks), and on the other hand, to
    ensure the load and stability of the servers;
    <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="m182">Contact and Inquiry Management</h3>
<p>
  When contacting us (e.g., by post, contact form, email, telephone, or via
  social media) and in the context of existing user and business relationships,
  the information provided by the inquiring individuals is processed to the
  extent necessary to respond to the contact inquiries and any requested
  measures.
</p>

<ul class="m-elements">
  <li>
    <strong>Processed data types:</strong> Contact data (e.g., email, phone
    numbers); Content data (e.g., entries in online forms); Usage data (e.g.,
    visited websites, interest in content, access times); Meta, communication,
    and process data (e.g., IP addresses, time data, identification numbers,
    consent status).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Data subjects:</strong> Communication partners.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Purposes of processing:</strong> Contact inquiries and
    communication; Management and response to inquiries; Feedback (e.g.,
    collecting feedback via online form); Provision of our online offerings and
    user-friendliness.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="m328">Plugins and Embedded Features and Content</h3>
<p>
  We integrate functional and content elements into our online offering that are
  obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred
  to as "third-party providers"). These may include graphics, videos, or maps
  (hereinafter collectively referred to as "content").
</p>

<p>
  The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content
  process the IP address of the users, since without the IP address, they would
  not be able to send the content to the user's browser. The IP address is
  therefore required for the presentation of this content or functions. We
  endeavor to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address
  solely for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may also use
  so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for
  statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate
  information, such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The
  pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device
  and may contain technical information about the browser and operating system,
  referring websites, visit times, as well as other information regarding the
  use of our online offering, and may be linked to such information from other
  sources.

    <strong>Google Fonts (Access from <b>local</b> Server):</strong> Access to
    fonts (and symbols) for the purpose of technically secure, maintenance-free,
    and efficient use of fonts and symbols in terms of up-to-dateness and
    loading times, their uniform presentation, and consideration of possible
    licensing restrictions. The provider of the fonts is informed of the user's
    IP address so that the fonts can be provided in the user's browser. In
    addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating
    system, hardware used) are transmitted, which are necessary for the
    provision of fonts depending on the devices used and the technical
    environment. This data can be processed on a server of the font provider in
    the USA. When users visit our online offering, their browser sends browser
    HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e., a software interface for
    fetching fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides users with the Cascading
    Style Sheets (CSS) of Google Fonts and then the fonts specified in the CSS.
    These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the respective user
    to access the internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3)
    the HTTP headers, including the user agent describing the browser and
    operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referring
    URL (i.e., the website on which the Google font is to be displayed). IP
    addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers, and they are not
    analyzed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of the HTTP requests
    (requested URL, user agent, and referring URL). Access to this data is
    restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font
    families that the user wants to load. This data is logged so that Google can
    determine how often a particular font family is requested. The Google Fonts
    Web API requires the user agent to adapt the font to the browser type
    generated for the respective browser type. The user agent is primarily
    logged for debugging and is used to generate aggregated usage statistics
    that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregated usage
    statistics are published on the "Analytics" page of Google Fonts. Finally,
    the referring URL is logged so that the data can be used for production
    maintenance and an aggregated report on the top integrations based on the
    number of font requests can be generated. According to its own statement,
    Google does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to
    create profiles of end users or to display targeted ads;
